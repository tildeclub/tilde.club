tilde.club
==========

This is the set of code and utilities for running and managing the
tilde.club server.

# What is tilde.club?
- [https://tilde.club](https://tilde.club) is one unmodified unix server on the Internet
  - Several hundred people have accounts
  - It was launched at the end of September 2014
- Tilde.Club is *also* an emerging, mutually supportive community of <del>dozens</del> <del>hundreds</del> thousands of people launching similar servers.
  - These people enjoy working in the tool-rich, very social Unix programming environment. 
  - Many of these people want to help new users use these open, free tools to empower themselves. 
    - Even new users who are scared of command-lines. 
    - Especially new users who want to learn but don't like being laughed at. 
    - _We won't laugh at you because we know how hard it is to learn about technology._
    - _If this is confusing we will try to help._
- [Here is the story of how tilde.club started](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf). Basically, one person had a few too many drinks and launched a cheap computer in the cloud. Github user @ftrain is the initiator and recently Github user @mbuchholz81 has taken over tilde.club from @ftrain.
- [Here is the FAQ](https://tilde.club/wiki/faq.html) which is being developed here at this GitHub repository.
- No particular entity controls tilde.club. It's emerging as sort of an open, basically free mini-Internet for people who need some refuge from the regular Internet. It was founded with the rule, "no drama," a rule directly inspired by the  Mary J. Blige song  "No More Drama." So far there's only been a little drama. It's only been three weeks, though. If we're honest with ourselves there is going to be drama.

It's all moving very fast.

# Help Wanted
Tilde.club is moving very quickly and is 100% volunteer led.

## 1. optimal: pull requests and bug reports
- There is a lot of great work going on around config, FAQ, basic docs.
- Jump in if you want. Literally everyone here said "I am ready to help, what can I do."
- We need non-coders  (writers, editors, communicators, artists, project managers) as much as we need tech folks.
- Most of the coding work is done for us by the Unix operating system. We're celebrating that.
- A lot of the basic docs are in the [wiki](https://github.com/tildeclub/tilde.club/wiki) which you (yes, you) can edit.

## 2. suboptimal: open ended feature requests and broad discussion
- We love philosophy, just not in our issue tracker!
